This is a simple simulator for RFID networks to implement 
decentralized RFID algorithms using Writable tags. 

At the time been, RRE is implemented. It would be easy to implement 
LEO, RANDOM and DRRE with simple modifications. 

We suggest that for each algorithm, we create a seperate subclasses for 
Reader, Tag, TagContent, MessagePair. 


Note: MessagePair seems to be very similar to TagContent. We keep it 
though, for readability. 



 
The algorithm included: 
RRE, LEO, DRRE, RANDOM, RANDMO+, GDE, GDE-SI, MinMax.
